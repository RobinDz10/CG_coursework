B581/Fall 2022		Lab 03		Duozhao Wang		duozwang

In lab 03, I followed the instructions from the lab tasks. Moreover, I combined the translation and rotation all together in Cube 1, which makes 
Cube 1 move and rotate in the same time. 

I also learned how to control game object by using keyboard. So I think it will not be hard to learn controlling object by mouse click or mouse 
movement? Maybe. Besides, I also applied camera settings in my task.
