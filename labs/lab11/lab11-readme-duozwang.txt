B581/Fall 2022		Lab 11		Duozhao Wang		duozwang

For lab 11, I created a 3D unity project named GraphCubs. Also I finished the tutorial of Building a Graph.
I will work on the rest of this project.

11-08-2022 Update:
I finished all the task B as required by the homework 05 instructions.
Now all the graph cubes have been scaled about the axis that passes through two of its opposite corners.
Also, all the graph cubes are rotating distinctly.
