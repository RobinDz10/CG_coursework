Task B:
1.
Temperature scale A:
freezing point Af: 0, bolling point Ab: 100
Temperature scale B:
freezing point Bf: -150, bolling point Bb: 300
Convention formulas for A -> B: B = (9 / 2) * A
Convention formulas for B -> A: A = (2 / 9) * B
2.
F(t) = 180 * t + 32
C(t) = 100 * t


Task C:
1. Yes, I think we can use only triangles to build objects in computer graphics. Every polygon can be divided into triangles. If we need to 
build an object with curved-surface, we only need to use more triangles to make the surface approximately smoothy.
2. Now we have the two endpoints of the line segment and the rectangular window. If two endpoints are both inside this rectangular window area,
 this means the line segment is clipped out by the rectangular window completely. If only one of the two endpoints is inside this rectangular 
window, this means the line segment is clipped out by the rectangular window partially. If both of the two endpoints are outside this rectangular 
window, there could be two possibility: We know that two endpoints can construct the explicit line function of this line, and we do know the four 
line functions of each edge of the rectangular window. If the line segment is intersected with any one of the edge line of the rectangular window, 
in this condition, the line segment is partially visible, otherwise the line is not clipped by the window (completely visible).


Task D:
a. The stage that precedes Primitive Assembly and Rasterization is called vertex shading stage. Vertex shading stage is used for vertex transformation, etc.
   The stage that follows Primitive Assembly and Rasterization is called fragment shading stage. Fragment shading shage is used for fragment texturing 
and coloring, etc.
b. The primitives that get assembled in the Primitive Assembly stage are:
   points, lines, polygon, etc.
